This is Prem GuptaðŸ˜Š. I am in final year in B.Tech at School of Computer Engineering, KIIT(Deemed to be University). I am looking to pursue a engaging career and be part of a growing organization that gives a scope to enhance my knowledge and utilize my skills towards the growth and profit of the organisation.

I am a self driven and versatile individual with an interest in problem-solving and passion for strategy development, leadership activities and writing.I desire to make a positive impact on the people around me and hope to achieve this through projects and internships.

I use and solve in the languages medntioned:
C/C++	Java  Python 	Octave	SQL		CSS		HTML  JS

I have completed my roles as Software Developer Intern at CPPSECRETS, Machine Learning Trainee at Verzeo.I worked on a project of making B2B application as an trainee intern in HighRadius. Currently I am paid Consulting Technical Intern working on webagents, parsers and many other amazing concepts and techniques.

Here's a little insight into what motivates me:
Computer Science has impacted the way we live our lives and how we grow. The knowledge, skills and problem solving learned through the study of Computer Science has evidently found applications in almost every job sector. Being a fan of learn by doing, I apply the skills and concepts I learn in the classroom and do hands-on implementation. My past research and internship experiences reflect this as I learn more and explore the opportunities Computer Science has to offer.
